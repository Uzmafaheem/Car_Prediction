#  Car_Prediction
##  Project Overview
Developed a car price prediction model using machine learning techniques to estimate vehicle prices based on features like mileage, age, fuel type, and engine size.
Cleaned and preprocessed a dataset of over 10,000 car listings, handling missing values, outliers, and categorical variables using one-hot encoding.


## Technical Skills
Data Cleaning: Used Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy to clean and preprocess data, ensuring high-quality inputs for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Created new features such as car age and encoded categorical variables to improve model performance.
Machine Learning: Applied regression algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict car prices, achieving an R² score of 0.99.
Data Visualization: Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations (e.g., correlation heatmaps, residual plots) for exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Tools and Technologies

Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost
Techniques: Data cleaning, feature engineering, regression modeling, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning

## Key Achievements

Achieved high model accuracy: Built a Linear Regression model with an RMSE of 64.75 and R² of 0.9995, outperforming other algorithms like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
Identified key drivers of car prices: Used feature importance analysis to determine that mileage, car age, and engine size were the most significant predictors of price.
Improved model interpretability: Conducted residual analysis and cross-validation to ensure the model met linear regression assumptions and generalized well to unseen data.
