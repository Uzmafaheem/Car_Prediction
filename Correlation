Close to 0: Weak or no correlation.
Key Insights from the Correlation Series

# 1. Strong Positive Correlation

Engine_Size (0.357):
Cars with larger engines tend to have higher prices.
This makes sense, as larger engines are often found in luxury or performance vehicles.

Fuel_Type_Electric (0.226):
Electric vehicles tend to have higher prices compared to other fuel types.
This could reflect the premium pricing of electric cars in the market.

# 2. Weak Positive Correlation

Fuel_Type_Hybrid (0.048):
Hybrid vehicles have a slight positive correlation with price.
This suggests that hybrid cars are priced slightly higher than average.
Brand_Chevrolet (0.017), Brand_Mercedes (0.013), Brand_Volkswagen (0.008):
These brands have a very weak positive correlation with price.
This could indicate that cars from these brands are priced slightly higher than the average.

# 3. Weak Negative Correlation

Brand_Ford (-0.00004), Brand_Toyota (-0.006), Brand_Hyundai (-0.008), Brand_BMW (-0.016), Brand_Honda (-0.020):
These brands have a very weak negative correlation with price.
This suggests that cars from these brands are priced slightly lower than the average.

# 4. Moderate to Strong Negative Correlation

Transmission_Manual (-0.112), Transmission_Semi-Automatic (-0.133):
Manual and semi-automatic transmissions are associated with lower prices.
This could reflect consumer preferences or the fact that automatic transmissions are often found in more expensive cars.

Fuel_Type_Petrol (-0.142):
Petrol vehicles tend to have lower prices compared to other fuel types.
This could reflect the lower cost of petrol vehicles compared to electric or hybrid vehicles.

Mileage (-0.551):
Higher mileage is strongly associated with lower prices.
This makes sense, as cars with higher mileage are generally considered less valuable.

Car_Age (-0.663):
Older cars are strongly associated with lower prices.
This is expected, as cars depreciate in value over time.

# Actionable Insights

Key Drivers of Price:
Car_Age and Mileage are the strongest predictors of price (highest absolute correlation values).

Engine_Size and Fuel_Type_Electric also have a significant impact on price.

Feature Selection:

Focus on features with strong correlations (e.g., Car_Age, Mileage, Engine_Size, Fuel_Type_Electric) for building the model.

Consider dropping or combining features with very weak correlations (e.g., Brand_Chevrolet, Brand_Ford, Brand_Toyota).

Business Implications:

Electric and hybrid vehicles command higher prices, which could inform marketing and pricing strategies.

Older cars and high-mileage cars are priced lower, which could help in setting fair prices for used vehicles.
